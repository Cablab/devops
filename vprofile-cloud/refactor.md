# VProfile Refactor

The purpose of this project is to take the VProfile project that exists in the AWS Cloud (as setup in [lift-and-shift.md](lift-and-shift.md)) and refactor it to use native AWS services instead of different EC2 instances running third-party services

- This refactor project will jump to use [vprofile-project/aws-Refactor branch of class repo](https://github.com/devopshydclub/vprofile-project/tree/aws-Refactor)
